    <h2>What is a Virus?</h2>
    <p>
      A virus is a very small infectious agent that can only reproduce inside the living cells
        of animals, plants, or bacteria. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and cannot survive
        on their own.
  </p>

    <h2>Why Are Viruses Important?</h2>
    <p>
        Although viruses can cause diseases, they are also important for science.
        They help scientists understand genetics, evolution, and how cells work.
        Some viruses are even used in medicine to treat diseases and develop vaccines.
    </p>

    <h2>Viruses and Human Health</h2>
    <p>
        Viruses such as the flu virus and coronavirus can affect human health.
        Thanks to science, vaccines and medicines help protect people and save millions of lives
        every year.
